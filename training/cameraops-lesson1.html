                To run and operate a camera, these are the steps you must follow…
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Walk into the sanctuary and come up to a camera.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Find the silver colored box, located on the side of the camera or inside the pouch, then press the
                    power button — this provides power to the camera rig.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>(Only Applies to Camera 1 & 3) Find a black power box (used for recording gear), power this unit on
                    by pressing the power button.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>(Only Applies to Camera 1 & 3) If an SSD is not already inside of the black recording box, pick one
                    up in the media room, and insert it into the black box.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>On the right side of the camera, you’ll find a power switch. Hold down this switch, to turn the
                    camera on. A red light should power on — the monitor on the camera should power on as well.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Locate the power button on the external monitor, flip the toggle to the “on” position.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Located on the right-hand side of the lever controls are the “zoom-in-and-out” functions. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Located on the left hand side are toggles for manual and auto focusing. The nob located to the left
                    of this switch adjusts the focus. To “rack” focus, turn the wheel to adjust the focus of the camera.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>To adjust the iris (the brightness of the image), be sure the iris setting is switched to manual –
                    on the left hand side of the control. You’ll also find a tiny black nob on the top of the left hand
                    stick, you can turn this to brighten(to the right) or darken(to the left) the image
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br>

            <p>
                <strong>How to Operate a "Wireless / Roamer Camera"</strong> 
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make sure you grab a battery out of the media production room and a rig to put the camera on your shoulder. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Make sure you are quiet and respectful walking to and from the stage.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    When on the stage connect the cable into the camera and plug in your battery. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Turn on the camera using the power switch on the right hand side.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Flip out your preview monitor and use it to set the focus and iris.</li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    To set the focus use the sliding ring on the front of the camera after the camera is set to manual.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    You can set the iris to auto or use the skinny sliding ring on the front to change it if in manual mode.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Always be careful handling the camera and keep an eye on your battery levels.
                </li>
            </ol>
