                <strong>
                    Adding songs to a playlist
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                To add a song to a playlist all you need to do is go to the search bar on the left side of the screen
                that says library. Once you are there type in whatever song you are needing to find. Once you have found
                it, click and drag over into the playlist.
                <br> <br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> we might not have the song downloaded yet. If we do not click on the song and a tab should come
                up. In that tab just click on the icon that is in the top right hand corner ( it should look like a
                piece of paper with a plus). Once you have done that the song will be added in your library. Finally go
                threw the slides to make sure that there are no grammatical errors.
                <br> <br>
                If you have added a new song to the library to make sure that you add the appropriate cues for it.
                Multiscreen cue is used for multi tracks.Stage display is for the back screen. This also goes for adding
                videos, graphics, and music.
                <br> <br>
                To find out what songs we need to be added to the playlist for that service all you need to do is go to
                <i><a target="blank" href="https://c3.tv/worshipcentral">https://c3.tv/worshipcentral</a></i>. In there it should say what songs we need ready for the upcoming service
                <br> <br>
                There may be times when you can't look up a song, so you will have to make the slide your self. To do
                this, click on the new playlist button and give it the title of the song. Once you do that you can add
                the appropriate slide that are needed for the song.
            </p>
            <br> <br>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Adding a video, graphic, or audio
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                In the top middle part of the screen there should be three icons that say video/image, audio, and pro remote. To add a video graphic or image to the playlist click the icon that says video/image. Once you are in there find what you want, then click and drag into the playlist. The same thing works for the audio as well. 
                <br> <br>
                If the media is not in pro presenter all you have to do add it in to pro presenter. To do that just click the video/image button in the middle of the screen. There will be different groups of videos or images. Take the video or image that is outside of pro presenter and just drag it into one of those groups.  
            </p>
            <br> <br>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Using slides during a service:
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                To choose a slide or a video all you have to do is simply click on it. Once you do the cues will automatically put the slide or video on the appropriate screen. Sometimes a slide or graphics will need to be removed without anything to replace it. To do that all you need to do is look to the top left and there should be 4 icons that say clear all, clear BKGs, clear Slides, or clear Audio. These for the most part self explanatory and will clear or stop anything that is currently on the screen.Clear BKGs will stop any video or graphic. Clear slide will clear slide. Clear audio will clear audio.
                <br> <br>
                As far as the organization of the slides go for the most part all of the slides are in order and organized by things such as course, verse, etc. These should help you keep up with what they are doing in song. One more helpful tip with timing from slide to slide, wait for the singer to say the last word of whatever current slide you are on. As they are saying it immediately go to whatever next slide they are about to say is. This helps because there is a bit of a buffer between what we hear and see during service and what is actually going on.If there is ever a time when no one is singing or talking any more make sure that the Slide is clear.
                <br> <br>
                There are also slides that are just for the sermon when pastor is preaching. These slides are a bit easier than the worship songs just because they are not changing nearly as much. You should look over wha slides have been laid out for his sermon before it starts just so you are familiar with what he will be saying during service. Make sure to pay attention to what he was saying though, sometimes he goes out of order with the slides that we have setup.
