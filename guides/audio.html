                    Try “Alexa, Shuffle songs by ‘Hillsong Young and Free’,” OR “Alexa, Play music by Elevation Worship.” If you hear Alexa respond “Ok,” then you may not need to move on to the next steps.
                </li>  
                <br>
                <li>
                    If you do not hear Alexa reply to your request, or if you don’t hear the requested music playing in the Hall then you may need to change an output on the mixer located next to the Alexa unit. You can do this by following these steps…
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Be sure Alexa is connecting: Unplug the audio cable from the back of Alexa, and repeat the request. If she responds and plays your request then an issue with the mixer is most likely the case. However; If she does not respond to your request, or says there’s an error with connecting, there may be an issue with Alexa, our Servers, or Amazons Servers.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>Step 2:</strong> Locate the Mixer, next to the Alexa Unit.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Be sure the “mute” button is not clicked, and that the volume nob is turned up, at least 3/2 of the way.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>Step 4:</strong> Check to see if the correct input is selected on the mixer. Input A is used to broadcast the live service feed to the hall. And Input B is used to broadcast audio output from the Alexa unit. 
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>Step 5:</strong> Change to the correct setting of your desired output, for Alexa, chose input B by pressing down on the physical button on the mixer.               
                </li>
                <br> <br>
                <li>
                    If you’ve changed to the correct output, and do not hear any audio or the audio is extremely loud or soft then you may need to re-load an audio profile. To do this, locate the audio AMP. This AMP is located in the rack below the Alexa and Mix units. Counting from the top, it is 6 rows down. Use the large scroll nob on the left hand side of the unit, to-navigate-to “load profile”. Click enter, and then click ‘load profile’ Once the profile is loaded, sound should return to its normal state. 
                </li>
                <br> <br>
